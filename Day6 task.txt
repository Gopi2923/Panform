//1. Error was due to quotes not applied. Corrected the same
//=======================================================
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<body>
    <script>
        alert("Iâ€™m JavaScript!");
    </script>
    Whats the error in this ?
</body>

</html>

//2. Error in quotes and name of the script (script.js -> scripts.js. Corrected the same
//=========================================================
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

    <script src="scripts.js"></script>

//3. Explain how below sequence of alerts work
//=============================================
//script.js
//Below are observations:
//All alerts work. Only issue is string "World" split into 2 lines which effects user experience
//Without semicolon also java script code works
//Addition of number in multiple lines work properly. It only impacts the code readability but not functionality
alert("I'm JavaScript!");
alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon
alert(`Wor
 ld`)
alert(3 +
    1
    + 2); // this is multiple line code and its working

//4. Fix below
//=============
//script.js
//Fix: Space added between two words
let admin = 9, fname = 10.5;
fname = "Guvi";
lname = "geek"
admin = fname + " " + lname;
alert(admin); // "Guvi geek"

//5. Fix below
//==============
//script.js
//Fix: Space added between two words and Template literal added in the alert block replacing the single quotes
let fname = 10.5;
fname = "Guvi";
lname = "geek"
let name = fname + " " + lname;
alert(`hello ${name}`);
